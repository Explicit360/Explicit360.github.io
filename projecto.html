    <h2>Which do you think is the bigger influence one one's personality-heredity (Genetic Code) or environment ( influence of the people and culture around?) Explain your answer.</h2>

    <p>I don't really think that personalities were inherited, we develop by influences we captured around us. I disagree from the inheritance of the personality, it must depend on how we were raised, on how we grow up on developing our own preferences. People are always different, this is why there are multiple types of interests. Each of them were distributed by different kinds of individuals across the world. Life is so inconsistent, its instinct is too change rapidly, which is how things are developed. we have our own path, people don't have similar ambitions. This is why we always end up with conflicts, we refuse to compromise because our own opnions are tremendously different. This is one of the reasons on why we seperate ways. Some people would prefer this, some would prefer that. We can't expect the same exact things, we got to embrace the reality that everyone of us has our own opinions. In conclusion, we inherit our personalities in certain things we cling to, not by our ancestors.  Personality heredity are not yet confirmed, nonetheless some scientists strive to research about it since they could be curious which made them try to find solid evidences from this certain concept. But as for me, it doesn't seem that this notion where we inherit our personality looks quite conspicous through the reality.  </p>
